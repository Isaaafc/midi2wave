## Applications

We can build many useful cases such as live jamming with AI and "Harmonizer".

## Plan of implementation

Midi2Wave builds on many previous structures, it is neccessary to understand the previous ones before diving into implementing this.

In order, the structures to implement are:

- [PixelCNN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1601.06759.pdf)
- [Gated PixelCNN](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6527-conditional-image-generation-with-pixelcnn-decoders.pdf)
- [WaveNet](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.03499.pdf)
- Midi2Wave
